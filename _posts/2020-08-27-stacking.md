### Data

The dataset consists of sentences from customer reviews of different restaurants. There are 2241, 800, 800 customer reviews in the train, development, and test datasets, respectively. Our task is to identify the category of each customer review using the review text and the trained model.
The categories include:<br/>
* FOOD: reviews that involve comments on the food.
e.g. “All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious”
* PAS: reviews that only involve comments on price, ambience, or service.
e.g. “Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you”
* MISC: reviews that do not belong to the above categories including sentences that are general recommendations reviews describing the reviewer’s personal experience or context, but that do not usually provide information on the restaurant quality
e.g. “Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!”
e.g. “I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an original deli”
